    Python is a language created by Dutch developer Guido van Rossum. He majored in computer science and mathematics at the University of Amsterdam and worked in a laboratory called the Centrum voor Wiskunde en Informatica (CWI) to improve the interpreted language. In the meantime, CWI has created a programming language called 'ABC' with team members. Four or five years after the ABC language project started, CWI ended the project because it had no visible results. During this process, Guido van  Rossum moved to a team called 'Amoeba' of the same company and proceeded to study microchannel-based distributed system environment.
